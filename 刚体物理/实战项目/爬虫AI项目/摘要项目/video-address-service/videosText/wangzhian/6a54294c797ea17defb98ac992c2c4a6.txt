Leader: One area, one floor, I will talk about it once, okay?
I talk floor by floor
Then communicate with everyone
Now please return to your dormitory in an orderly manner
If I didn't go to any dormitory tonight
It is my responsibility
If any student in the dormitory has opinions tonight, they can talk about it
Student shouts: Demolish the wall first...
Classmates, classmates, everyone (noisy)
I came here specially today (the subtitles team can't hear clearly o(╥﹏╥)o)
Please be in an orderly manner (interrupted by the sound of the wall being demolished)
(Students applaud)
This video you just saw
It is a video that happened on May 15 at the Wanliu Campus of Peking University
In the middle of the video, several students knock down a wall
Then there is a school leader communicating with the students
The ins and outs of this thing are like this
Recently, the epidemic situation in Beijing has become more serious
All units have begun to implement more stringent prevention and control measures
Peking University is no exception
Wanliu Campus of Peking University
In fact, it is not in the headquarters of Peking University
Quite some distance to Peking U
Peking University has developed rapidly in recent years
The number of students is also increasing
In order to allow these students to have a place to live
Just off campus in many places
Purchased some land to build student dormitory
Wanliu Campus is one of them
Wanliu Campus has only residential area, no teaching area
Except for the student dormitory
There are also some teachers' dormitories
The Wanliu Campus is mainly inhabited by graduate students of Peking University
after this pandemic
Peking University stipulates that students cannot go out for a walk casually
Can't leave the area
Have to be in the dormitory
If you want to go to our school, there is a closed-loop school bus
After the closed-loop school bus goes up, it will be pulled directly to the school for class
But students found
Teachers in the teachers' dormitory area of ​​Wanliu Campus
They can go out and go shopping
They can also go for a walk
The students are out of balance
If it is due to the epidemic
If you can't go out, everyone can't go out
It is impossible to say that students carry the virus
The teacher does not carry the virus
Students may be infected when they go out
The teacher will not be infected when he goes out?
This logic is not understood by people from Peking University
People from Beijing Jiaotong University and Beijing University of Technology
Even a person in a secondary school can think clearly
Students had opinions
Students make requests to the school
In this case
Or everyone can go out for a walk
Either you can't go out for a walk
Because everyone is in the same community
From the perspective of epidemic prevention, this should also be the case
student's request
should be reasonable
As a result, how did Peking University deal with it?
Peking University divides Wanliu campus into two
Separate the dormitory area between teachers and students
A wall was built in the middle
Students are students, teachers are teachers
The student area is relatively small
Among them, supermarkets and barber shops are almost all on the teacher's side
The teacher can still go out
Students cannot go out later
The active area has become smaller
Now the students of Peking University are quitting
May 15th
students began to gather near the wall
Some students even started shouting slogans
in the evening
First came a school leader to communicate with the students
but no effect
At that time, it was said that the main communication was about the school bus
The more and more students gathered, there were several hundred
Until about 22:40 in the evening
here comes a vice-principal
The vice-principal's name is Chen Baojian
Chen Baojian is mainly responsible for the ideological and political work of students in the school
equivalent to a commissar in the military
He is relatively experienced
Communicate with students when they arrive at the scene
Then tell the students
I won't leave if the problem is not solved today
Tonight I'm going to walk through every dorm in the Wanliu dormitory area
Some students shouted from below
"What are you doing in the girls' dormitory so late?"
Everyone booed him there
in the middle of talking
Everyone heard a rumbling from behind
The wall was torn down
Students go up spontaneously
The wall between the teacher's dormitory area and the student's dormitory area was torn down
The conflict between the two sides is acute
There goes the conflict
The school leader, Principal Chen kept talking to the students
Reassure students and communicate with students
By 11 p.m.
A student came out and said
If you trust me
I will communicate with the school leaders on behalf of everyone
Some students doubt
This student was actually sent by the school to divide the students
Some people think this student is brave
We don't have much information
I also based on some information from the Peking University campus
Restoration site
In general
At this time, the students began to appear a little soft
The student's advice to the school is
If we have to be isolated
Allocate more garden areas to students
Can't give the teacher so much
Another is to increase the number of closed-loop school buses
Make it easier for students to go to the headquarters of Peking University
around 12 p.m.
The students began to disperse
It's said to be around one o'clock in the morning
The counselors of each department began to talk to the students in their own departments
Encourage students to supervise and expose each other
Identify who was there that night
Register students going to the field
On the second day, the problem was basically solved
Chen Baojian brought it up
The wall was removed, and the barrier at the door was also removed
On-site guarantee not to process any students
objectively speaking
Peking University students are quite satisfied with the results of this treatment
And the school is trying to appease the emotions of the students
Immediately began to adopt a series of Huairou policies
For example, Wanliu Campus used to be inconvenient to buy things
Don't let go for a walk
Ordering takeout is even more difficult now
The school of Peking University contacted a Jingkelong supermarket
Free delivery to students by car
If you want to buy something, they send it right away
There must have been no such treatment before there was trouble
The teacher who led the exercise in the physical education class came to the scene to lead the students to dance
It's boring because students can't go out in isolation
The school also arranged for these activities to watch movies
I even heard that game coupons will be issued to students
Begin to buy students, follow the Huairou policy
this reminds me
A story I had just graduated from college
when i graduated from college
Worked as a teacher at Inner Mongolia University of Technology for two years
Later, he was admitted to graduate school and went to Peking University to study
When I was a teacher at Inner Mongolia University of Technology
The school canteen is divided into student canteen and teacher canteen
Our young staff are eating in the staff cafeteria downstairs
The food in the staff cafeteria is extremely bad, very unpalatable
We young teachers are single
Live in a building called Building 8
have we complained to the school many times, no one listens to us
Young teachers are vulnerable groups
who can take care of us?
Those older teachers have started their own families and eat at home
As young teachers, generally they are just entering the school to work
No place in school and no one to care
I just graduated from college
Young and brave
I think this matter needs to be resolved
I'm "connecting" in Building 8
I told the youth faculty
Let's organize a "strike" to solve this problem
Then I talked to a teacher in the Department of Chemical Engineering
Drafted a statement calling on everyone to "strike the stove" overnight
In the middle of the night, while the teachers are sleeping
After I print the statement
Two of Us
Go to the dormitory door of every young faculty member and hang the proposal letter
Call on us not to eat at noon the next day
everyone upstairs just watching
See what they gonna do in the youth staff canteen
Next morning
The two of us observe like nothing
You know what happened?
Next noon
The food in the staff cafeteria is very good
The school leaders met our young teachers at the door
He pulled us in and said: Guest, Come and eat!
Today's food is very good
Young teachers in our building 8
They are all standing upstairs, leaning against the window and looking down
Because our building 8 is below the staff canteen
Then everyone is there booing
See who goes in
Whoever goes in is a "traitor"
Everyone looks down on him
At this time, see who can stand up
In the afternoon, the school leaders came to negotiate with us
When negotiating, leaders say to solve the problem
We must solve the quality problem of the staff canteen
I also spoke on behalf of young teachers
say we should solve this problem for us
Most people don't know that "strike the stove" was organized by me
It is said that the school leaders also knew about it later
I organized this
What I mean here is that
No trouble, no problem solving
Once there is trouble, the problem is quickly solved
and when it is resolved
Sometimes it exceeds your expectations
The staff canteen has been eating for a few days
It'll be like that again in a few days
This is the case with Peking University students
Do you solve problems when you don't see trouble?
not resolved
Once trouble, problem solved
This is one way China handles a lot of problems
Follow the normal procedure to report the problem and no one cares about you
In this way, the problem will be solved immediately
It's something special at Peking University
Why schools are so afraid of students getting together
Because students, especially Peking University students, gather together
Too strong symbolic color
This is scary
One is the media will report, especially the foreign media will report
There is another one that is really symbolic
Therefore, a very important job for the leaders of Peking University
Just can't let students participate in all kinds of group events
Can't even initiate any mass events
Everyone knows that since 1989
Or say so
since 1976
Peking University students are really involved in political events
It's that time in 1989
At other times, Peking University students had some troubles
when we study
Peking University originally had a Changpingyuan campus
A girl went to Changpingyuan campus from headquarters
At that time, there was no shuttle bus, so I took my own car
Or it seems like she missed that bus
I don't remember the details
When a girl returned from the headquarters to Changpingyuan campus
disappeared
Two days later, it was found that he had been raped and killed
At that time, many students of Peking University quit the job
students gather
Looks like a small parade
At that time, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau attached great importance to this
The criminals were caught soon
Looks like he was shot later
There were earlier
A student at Peking University ate at a restaurant on campus
Arguments or conflicts with people who eat at restaurants outside of school
People outside the school beat the Peking University students to death
The students of Peking University organized a parade overnight
Around Zhongguancun
Although the person who killed the person ran from Beijing to other places
But he was shot immediately after he was caught
Peking University students gather
For many departments
It's a huge political pressure
Very scary
It was also interpreted that
Is this thing happening again by the students of Peking University
Want to fight against China's epidemic prevention policy
I think it's more understandable
The truly political activities of Peking University since 1976
Just once in 1989
Other than that no
Others are relatively simple events
This time is no exception
The only privileges possessed are
After the students of Peking University made a fuss
The probability of getting a solution has become greater, or very high
Other than that, there is no other possibility
After 1989
Peking University is also consciously dividing and disintegrating students
Let them try not to get involved in politics
Peking University has a very famous place called "Triangle"
Many people have heard this name
But I don't know what the "triangle" looks like
Anyone who has studied at Peking University knows that
"Triangle" is actually a few tattered notice boards
There are ads all over the top
Various advertisements, lectures, notices, notices, etc.
The reason why it is a very important place for Peking University students
because everyone can post whatever they want
For example, the news of selling things, various notifications
Information on renting a house
But indeed for a long period of time
Many Peking University students are in that place
Posted some opinions that I want to express
So it has become the "Holy Land of Democracy" of Peking University
A place that looks shabby
Later, Peking University killed the "triangle"
Get rid of the "triangle"
For the sake of overall beauty
Because after the lecture hall of Peking University was demolished
built a memorial hall
The "Triangle" area has become very beautiful
"Triangle" looks out of place
Then cancel the "triangle"
Turned into a notice board in a glass window
The glass window has changed a lot
Ordinary people can no longer express their opinions in this place
I can't even put things on it myself
It seems that the environment has become beautiful
But its essence and core have changed
In my view
This is actually the intention of the Peking University management process
The carrier that allows students to gather slowly disappears
Students are less likely to organize
Let's come back to this question
Why are the authorities so afraid of student gatherings?
Especially afraid of Peking University students gathering together
What's the rationale behind this
I personally think there are several reasons
First
First
in the ideology of the Communist Party
students have natural legitimacy
We have read a book called "History of Chinese Revolution" from childhood to university
In "History of the Chinese Revolution"
There are several forces that promote historical progress
Peasant uprising
Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Hong Xiuquan, Boxer Rebellion
In our "History of the Chinese Revolution"
It is a positive energy of historical progress
Students too
Peking University students are the "foundation place" of the May Fourth Movement
Students from Peking University marched to Cao Rulin's residence
He dragged Cao Rulin out and beat him
Became the beginning of China's new democratic revolution
Mao Zedong listed this as the beginning of the new democratic revolution
There are a lot more
Including texts from our secondary school
"In Memory of Lord Liu Hezhen" written by Mr. Lu Xun
Liu Guozhen is a student
He was killed in the street parade
In the narrative line of "History of the Chinese Revolution"
students have natural legitimacy
Never been a anti party force
But if in the environment of new China
If students take to the streets
What you gonna do?
Are you going to crack down on students?
If you want to suppress him
Chairman Mao once said
"No good end for those who suppress students"
This is hard to deal with
Therefore, students should not be allowed to take to the streets casually.
Authorities are particularly afraid of students taking to the streets
To nip students in the street in the bud
Secondly
student movement
It is indeed very easy to translate into a social movement
Because the group of students
Relatively speaking, there are not too many restraints and fetters of interests
not like the average working class
He may be more concerned about his own industry
Or gain or lose your own interests in this field
For example, the owner makes a fuss
Most likely because of conflicting interests in his own community
But the demands of the students
It is often the public appeal of this society
Once it gets up
Students' emotions, thoughts and content
Particularly easy to spread to other areas of society
It's scary for the authorities
When students get angry
Driven by the working class and peasant class
that's serious
This is also the reason why students can't do it casually
Very scary
Of course, the Communist Party was very, very vigilant about social movements in New China
For example, when I go back to Beijing this time
I was chatting with a guy who made a documentary
He wanted to photograph a courier boy in Beijing
The courier guy wants to organize an organization like a union
He just sent a post on friends circle on Wechat with a mobile phone
Then he was taken away by the relevant departments, and this person disappeared
he doesn't know what was the situation
Then he sent a Weibo to find this person
Because he wants to shoot a video of the courier brother
Thinking this could be meaningful
Right after he sent out the Weibo
National Security Officer came to him
"What do you want to do, why are you looking for this person"
China's control system is the strictest
to a mass event like this
Especially events with a bit of ideological overtones
Say you want to organize a union
This will be considered as "kills without mercy"
Control is very strict
In my opinion, Peking University students
Through these years of "moisturizing and silent" control
Peking University students are also unlikely to go through other avenues
to express his political demands
You can only fight for your own interests
A lot of people might disagree
But I'll tell you a story
In 2018, 2019
There was an incident at Peking University
The famous "Marxist Club incident"
"Marxist Research Association"
Students engaged in a "Marxist Research Association"
The "Marxist Research Society"
They want to revive the theory of "Marxist Fundamentalism"
they think modern society
It's all capitalists exploiting workers
Workers' rights are not protected
because the exploiting classes exploit the proletariat
What is basically said in the original works of Marxism
These theories we also taught in our childhood politics class
The "Marxist Research Society" tries to revive
Such a Marxist thought
The "club" had an accident in 2018 and 2019
The workers of a factory in the south went on strike
"Strikes" are also extremely sensitive in China
Once found, it is also considered "kill without mercy"
Several students of the Marxism Research Society of Peking University
After hearing about this
They stand in solidarity with these striking workers
According to Marxist theory
The working class unites against the capitalists
It's full of justification and positive energy
But after we reformed and opened up
If workers everywhere go on strike
That's definitely high pressure
These students of the Marxism Research Society of Peking University think that
According to the theory of Marxism
Workers' strikes have natural legitimacy against capitalists
so they support
As a result, the public security bureau called these students from Peking University
Show them videos of other people's confessions
warn these students
Because after all, you are from Peking University, and I will leave you a face
"Did you see it? This is the end, confession!"
As a result, after the students of the Marxist Research Association returned
not only did not compromise
Instead, they posted these videos online.
Also accepted foreign media interviews
this is serious
They were arrested immediately
Among them, the head of the Marxist Research Society was also ordered to drop out of school
And the Marxist Research Society has also been reorganized
The school sent someone in
It is equivalent to dismantling the Marxist Research Society
There are two factors to explain this
One is the doctrine of Marxism
In today's China, you can't talk casually
Is China still a socialist country?
This is a question, let me talk about it first
I personally feel that the policies of the Chinese Communist Party today
In fact, it is very, very far away from Marxism
Look at those policies
I think the Chinese Communist Party today is more similar to the Social Democrats in the West
In fact, it is already a hundred and eighty thousand miles away from Marxism
such as Marxism put
Eliminate exploitation, eradicate private property, eradicate state and family
even when communism was realized
Labor is a self-need, a means of self-realization
Are we doing this in China today?
Obviously not
The eradication of capitalists is long overdue
The eradication of exploitation is long overdue
Of course, another set of theoretical explanations of economics
Whether there is exploitation or not, and what constitutes exploitation, is another question
In short, Marxism says
The idea of ​​eliminating private ownership and eliminating exploitation
No one mentions it in China
What China is doing today cannot be called socialism
You have to measure it by a standard of Marxism
Certainly not socialist
Therefore
Fundamentalist Marxism has turned into a heresy in China
Not just that
During the Cultural Revolution, there were a group of studious Red Guards
The more thoughtful Red Guards read the original works of Marxism
Read and read to find a problem
Contrast with the reality of Chinese society at that time
Say no to personality cult
Marxism against the cult of personality
At that time, China shouted long live Chairman Mao every day
Can this be called Marxism?
they were caught soon
At that time, Mr. Liu Binyan wrote a book called "The Second Kind of Loyalty"
Take a look if you are interested
The book was talking about the story and history
Not only today
Historically, Marxist fundamentalism was also not popular in China
Right now not just Marxist Clud
Or "The Land of Nothing"
"No Land" is Leftist
Similar to Marxist Fundamentalism
Not popular in China
Our authorities never liked them
Fundamentalist Marxism has no market in China
not officially recognized
Even is dangerous
That's first
Second, we can see
Relevant departments for students of Peking University
Relevant departments for students of Peking University
Once you want to engage in activities with political implications
The blow is merciless
Counting on Peking University students in this context
Representing 1.4 billion people in China to play games with the authorities
I personally think that many people think too much, it is unlikely
From my observation, Peking University students after 1989
Basically becoming more and more realistic
Most of the science students have gone abroad
Many students from the Department of Biology and Department of Chemistry go to North America
Liberal Arts students after graduation
Either in politics or in business
There are also family and country feelings, and the sense of responsibility of Peking University students
Want to engage in a movement to enlighten the people
This space is almost gone
In the end
I want to read a paragraph for you
A private message from a Peking University student
Protest this incident at Peking University Wanliu
He said: As far as the matter is concerned
The students of our school are quite satisfied with the handling of the Wanliu incident
I personally don't think it can be defined as
Peking University students resist the epidemic prevention and control policy
It's just that everyone protects their most basic equality and rights
But generally speaking
For the 
The emergence of Peking University's epidemic control
Public opinion control, restriction of personal freedom, embarrassing students, etc
What is needed is a change in system policy and the popularization of scientific thinking
There is nothing we can do about this
We also gradually changed from anger, dissatisfaction, to numbness
This is Peking University today
Today's Peking University Students
Thanks for watching, let's chat tomorrow (Subtitle: Zecheng)
