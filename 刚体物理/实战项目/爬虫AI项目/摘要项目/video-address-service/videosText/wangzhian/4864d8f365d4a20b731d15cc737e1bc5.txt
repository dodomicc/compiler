do I need to Draft today everyone knows
my topic like it CH passed away it's
really a very surprising news like Chang
is only 68 years old this year it seems
rather bizarre to as the highest leader
in China he just retired in March but
now he's died of heart disease which is
really quite odd the acceptable medical
system of the Chinese Communist party
for a senior National official whether
in office or retired the medical
security level is very high a medical
team accompanies us 247 and as ordinary
people we know that even if a heart
attack happens there is a golden rescue
time of a few minutes mainly a
defibrillators nearby and a medical team
will promptly follow up no issues should
arise the reason heart disease is
threatening is because for ordinary
people if we have a heart attack by the
time the ambulance arrives or when taken
to the hospital you are basically
already gone the golden few minutes for
rescuing my cardial infarction but for
these senior officials of the Chinese
Communist Party the threat of this heart
disease is not particularly great
because they have a very comprehensive
medical security system the last Chinese
Communist Party official to die of heart
disease was huya obang who passed away
in 1989 hu yobang died at 7: in the
morning but at that time the level of
Medical Care was not particularly high
in recent years medical Security in the
Chinese Communist party has made rapid
progress so it's difficult to see Senior
officials of the party die of heart
disease everyone knows Jang zamin Jang
he lived to be over 90 years old he had
two heart attacks in the meantime but he
was rescued both times and is
fine so you think as a senior National
official if Lee ketang 68 dies of a
heart attack it does sound very
unexpected moreover the news today first
emerged around 9:00 when domestic news
apps began to break the story someone
informed me right away saying Wang sir
hurry and look Lee Kang has passed away
but when I opened it to see the news had
already already been deleted it was
reposted about four or 5 minutes later
but there was something odd about the
news when it was
republished in the past news like the
death of party and state leaders was
first released by shinan news agency and
then forwarded by other news
platforms This Time It's Different the
news this time seemed to be released in
a hurry the orbitary even mentioned that
this information will be released later
this suggest that the news was released
very hastily without enough time to
release an orbitary moreover another
point is that other news platforms
release the news together and from what
I see it seems that the news client of
the central television released it even
earlier internal system of the Communist
Party of China there may also be some
power struggles and competition for
discourse power between CCTV and shinua
news agency in summary this news
immediately hit the headlines of major.
news outlets around the world today
during the process of the news release
just state that Lea Chang is resting in
Shanghai then he suffered a heart attack
but the exact cause and process remain
UND
disclosed everyone knows that the
Chinese Communist Party treats the
health information of their internal
party and state leaders as state secrets
and never discloses them however
information quickly surfaced online
including messages from some medical
community friends in Shanghai piecing
together the reason why Liang passed
away Liang was staying at the East
suburb guest house in Shanghai as many
know there are two State guest houses in
Shanghai one is the West suburb guest
house and the other is the East suburb
guest house house the West suburb Guest
House was built earlier and historically
figures like maidong joen Li and Jang
zamin preferred staying there when
visiting Shanghai the West suburb guest
house is quite beautiful with vast green
spaces a lake and many western style
Villas and small buildings scattered
about later on the East suburb guest
house was constructed situated in pong
its design Bears a resemblance to the
West suburb Guest House boasting a large
green area a lake and a forest however
it features a more modernized hotel now
both the East suburb hotel and the West
suburb hotel are open to the public but
there is an area here specifically for
the residence of party and state
leaders Leach Chang lives in the dong
Xiao hotel which is a specific area for
National
residents this area is not typically
open to the public as per a
knowledgeable person in Shanghai Leach
Chang suffered a sudden heart attack
while swimming yesterday morning having
a heart attack while swimming is the
riskiest but why well when you're
swimming in a pool and suddenly have a
heart attack the folks nearby might not
even realize it by the time they do and
fish you out of the water precious time
might have already been lost there's
another even deadlier point when you
have a heart attack while swimming
you're likely to experience drowning
because you're in the water and your
heart suddenly stops beating currently
you can't swim or control autonomous
breathing making it easy to choke on
water and experience drowning so after
leang suddenly had a heart attack at the
pool he was rushed to a hospital named
Dawn hospital near the dongjoo state
guest Hotel Dawn hospital is affiliated
with the Shanghai University of
traditional Chinese medicine and it's
fair to say that it doesn't rank very
high in terms of overall medical
standards in Shanghai because of the
association with traditional Chinese
medicine which is often considered a
scam though there are good Chinese
medicine unies now they teach both
Western and Chinese medicine level not
as good as modern Western
medicine in Shanghai the medical
programs at Fudan University and West
China Medical University are pretty
top-notch among others these hospitals
are highly regarded but perhaps due to
an emergency situation at the time the
nearest one was shuguang hospital so
Liang was taken to this hospital after
doctors from new internal Med and
surgery depths of major hospitals in
Shanghai were all summoned to ER of
shugang hospital yesterday in Shanghai
high price began to close
road then when taken to the dawn
Hospital emergency center the entire
vicinity of dawn hospital was completely
cordoned off by police police cars but
despite over 10 hours of rescue efforts
they couldn't be
[Applause]
saved leang died unexpectedly and the
leang is referred to as a member of the
Twan faction in China's political Arena
the so-called Tuan refers to the
Communist Youth League the Communist
Party of China's system besides the
party there are two Affiliated
organizations there's a group called The
Communist youth league and another
called the Young Pioneers they're
divided by age the young Pioneers is a
group that children join in Primary
School in junior high school they become
young people and join the Communist
Youth League then once you come of age
step into society and start working you
can actively seek to join the Chinese
Communist party so essentially the
previous two organizations are
Preparatory bodies for the CCP meaning
before you get into the organizational
system of the CCP first you join the
youth league then the young Pioneers
getting some initial training and
exposure to the most basic theories of
the CCP after reform a unique power
division formed communist youth league
and the Communist Party of
China in theory it's a prep organization
so it shouldn't have a large influence
however after the end of the cultural
revolution a problem emerged During the
Revolution mauo persecuted senior party
officials
so following the cultural revolution
these high-ranking officials made a
comeback because they too needed to
implement policies and provide some sort
of compensation to people however this
brought about a problem concerning the
demographic within the decision-making
bodies of the CCP from the central to
local levels there was a noticeable
aging population with most of the
individuals being in their 70s or 80s
attending these meetings dun xaing felt
that there was a problem so he proposed
to rejuvenate the kadras the term
youthification of the Padre refers to
you folks even though old ma persecuted
you but you can't just stand in this
position and not budge because if you do
the young folks can't move up if this
country is governed by old men can it
have a future back then to solve this
issue dunsha ping even specifically set
up an advisory committee what it meant
was get you guys into the Central
Committee where your benefits remain
unchanged you can even attend meetings
and voice your opinions but step aside
and give the positions to the young
folks when handing over to the younger
generation they face a problem during
the cultural revolution the CCP did not
cultivate
successes so when he was building his
Kad team there was a gap so it's not
easy to find young people at this time
the Communist Youth League naturally
joins the cause due to the nature of the
Communist youth league as an
organization its executives are
necessitated to be very young this fact
played a part in hu yobang being able to
serve as general secretary at the time
following huyang individuals like huin
Le Kang and wangyang all em merged from
the league as
executives
[Music]
cadr in this faction have several
characteristics the first being their
youth because the Central Committee of
the Communist youth league is led by a
ministerial level official but its
vertical management system enables a
particularly fast process of Cadre
promotion after the CPC implemented the
reform and opening up policy there was
an objective Criterion in cadra
selection which was
age what age to reach Department level
what age to reach Bureau level after
passing age stage no hope of promotion
remains currently the group Cadre has an
unmatched Advantage first off the cardr
within the Twan faction tend to be on
the younger site that's one second these
faction members generally don't share
the characteristic of coming from Red
families everyone knows the Communist
party is also a massive interest group
and there own second and third
generations of Reds are gradually
gaining power after all this is an
interest relationship where buildings
get the moon first by getting water for
instance currently within the high
ranking officials of the Chinese
Communist Party many come from Red
families Xi Jinping is a notable example
with his father being XI Jong shun boai
too his father hailed from a red family
I've always seen the Communist Party
akin to the military nobility group when
the Han Dynasty was just established
because this realm was fought for
collectively it's like our children are
slowly coming to share in this power
structure which is a distinctive
characteristic however faction cadres
are generally from poor families the
third and crucial feature group cadres
tend to have more open-minded thinking
they are receptive to reform and opening
up and generally accept Western
Universal values from Huang to huin to
Liang and onto wangyang these communist
Youth League officials this is a common
characteristic among communist Youth
League officials
although the cadres of the faction may
have a lack of Grassroots work
experience and their abilities may not
be particularly strong their thinking is
indeed relatively
open-minded
Lee Kang from Anu province with college
entrance exam resumption admitted to
peing University Law Department peeking
University and singua University are
China's top universities Student Union
presidents have privilege taking turns
as National Youth
chairman during Le Chang's time at peing
University he ran for the position of
student union president and became the
National Youth chairman cpc's Central
Committee established a relation after
graduation he briefly served as Youth
League committee secretary at PKU for
two yrs then joined C Central Committee
after this it began to rise rapidly at
43 upon arriving in Hanan he was already
the provincial governor and was
nicknamed the baby Governor becoming a
provincial Governor at 43 is not easy Le
K Chang groomed as Crown Prince from an
early age think about it it should be
said everyone thinks he is the future
number one person so he later served as
the governor of henan Province then
moved on to leoning Province to become
the secretary of the provincial Party
Committee and eventually landed a spot
at the central government as the highest
ranking Vice Premier before finally
becoming the premier of the state
Council there was a Twist in the tail
though when xiin ping emerged on the
scene halfway through so xiin ping and
leyang were locked in a rivalry during
that per period vying for the top spot
in the end Le kyang had to settle for
less failing to secure the position of
the General Secretary of the Communist
party and only making it to the premier
of the state Council now how should we
evaluate Lee Kang's 10-year tenure as
Premier especially since he passed away
today let's take a moment to reflect on
Le Kang's life and his most significant
period in office as Premier over the
last decade and discuss what he
accomplished I've done a show in the
past stating that Li kyang has been one
of the least noticeable Premier among
China's history of Premier why so it's
largely due to the power struggle he had
with Xi Jinping at the time as she
personally didn't trust him and never
really considered him one of his own so
Liang can exert his abilities such a
stage is actually very limited everyone
can imagine that in the past those few
Prime Ministers J rongi speech was
actually very lowkey including Lee
Pang yet when Lee Kang became premier
there was actually no
voice however Li Chang himself does he
really want to do it he definitely wants
to do
it when Lee Kang was Premier in 2013 he
once brought up a phrase saying reform
and opening up is China's biggest
dividend I think this phrase very much
embodies liang's characteristic which is
to say Liang still firmly hopes that
China can implement the policy of Reform
and opening up later a place used this
sentence to compile a book reform and
opening up up is China's biggest
dividend bringing together Lea Chang's
thoughts and speeches at that time when
Leach Chang became Premier it was
proposed to name it the Liang School of
Economics as he was the only Premier in
China with an economics PhD everyone has
high hopes for him so what was the
backdrop of the reform and opening up
proposed by leyang at the time which is
seen as China's biggest dividend the
backdrop is actually the gradual
disappearance of China's demographic
dividend many know that there are
factors behind China's reform and
opening up the demographic dividend
industrial transfer of countries like
Japan and Taiwan and China's WTO
accession have created economic
prosperity in China's 40 Years of Reform
and opening up but Le Kang questioned if
China can still develop after the
demographic dividend you should know
whether it's the demographic dividend or
the foreign trade dividend all these
came about after the economic reform
before that the cost of labor was even
cheaper so why didn't it Translate into
economic growth this shows that China's
biggest dividend wasn't actually the
demographic one what was it it was the
dividend brought about by the economic
reform it's because of systemic
Innovation creating a continuous stream
of dividends that's what propelled
China's economy into a period of rapid
growth which I think is a very sensible
analysis back in the Mao era and as
labor is cheap but development has not
occurred despite the disappearing
demographic dividend planned economy
hampers creativity meaning L to work
hard impossible for diligence to
translate into wealth in a system that
stifles
Innovation after the reform the CCP
prioritized economic construction
however the era of Liang faced a
challenge which is that the initial 30
years of Reform and opening up were
essentially developed through a
combination of decentralization and
concessions capitalizing on a
demographic dividend yet the act of
decentralization and making concessions
inherently has what's called it a
release period once what can be released
is nearly exhausted it's essentially
fully released plus following this F of
economic takeoff as we all know there
comes the so-called middle inome trap
faced by many if your industry can't be
upgraded and you can't overcome such a
bottleneck you may end up in a situation
like Latin American nations your
economic growth remains stagnant between
$5,000 and
$8,000 Leach Chang proposed reform and
opening up his China's biggest dividend
must avoid China falling into the Latin
American
trap the topic he talked about here is
actually the upgrading of China's
industrialization the so-called
industrial upgrading refers to the
gradual transition from a simple
platform developed by labor intensive
Industries to an information-based and
globalized fast lane of the new Chinese
economy inside this was a goal proposed
by Lee kachang during his first
term
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
spee
of course he knew that reform was not
easy during this process so when he was
the Prime Minister for the first time he
said a famous phrase that is well known
to everyone saying that touching
interests is even harder than touching
the soul he knows the reform entered a
deep water Zone due to huge interest
patterns and massive interest
adjustments in early China during
development decentralization and benefit
sharing led to incremental reform with
relatively small resistance to reform
but it's different when you enter the
Deep Water Area involving adjusting
interests like healthc care reform
everyone knows about Healthcare reform
China has different medical insurance
systems including one for National
cadres there are employees and migrants
in theory all citizens of China should
have an equal Social Security System but
the reform process needs significant
adjustments to interests are government
officials willing to sympathize with
migrant workers definitely not but they
are also the creators of Reform policies
so the resistance must be strong liit
Chang's touching interest is harder than
touching the soul refers to
this however Le K Chang's economic
development in the past 10 years has
been good but there is little to show in
terms of mechanism reform and
institutional reform especially when he
entered his term and was then met with
the pandemic let alone reforms everyone
knows that Xi Jinping has reversed the
gears particularly by the second term
it's clear as day that Xi Jinping wants
to serve again which is now a secret
known to all Le Chang sees it in his
eyes and he must also feel it in his
heart he can't stop all this so in the
last couple of years before stepping
down Lea Chang mentioned it
[Music]
frequently
[Music]
but at this time when he was talking
about this information I think he is no
longer a so-called policy but what it is
a so-called
appeal he believes that although the
yansi river and the Yellow River will
not reverse their flow reform is
possible don't assume reform won't
backtrack he stated our reform and
opening up discussions won't cease but
it's merely his expectation
[Applause]
yeah
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
for
[Applause]
[Applause]
by the way when I Was preparing for this
episode I was thinking about a question
if a decade ago when Xi Jinping and Lee
Kang were competing for the position of
General Secretary of the Communist the
selection system of the Chinese
Communist Party ultimately chose leang
instead of xiin ping what would have
happened then how would the past decade
have turned out and what about the
upcoming decade party of China Lee Kang
may not have been as capable as Xi
Jinping and he may not have been as
decisive and
ambitious but Lee K Chang in my opinion
has a few points first he may continue
to adhere to the path of reform and
opening up and continue to prioritize
Economic Development because most
previous officials have followed this
path secondly he will definitely not
break the term system for leading cadres
because he neither has the ability nor
the
ambition so I was thinking for a big
country like China what quality is the
most important for selecting the top
leader is your ability and ambition the
most important or is it more important
to follow the rules and regulations and
not mess with
around everyone knows that the phrase no
fuss was coined during hen's tenure when
the phrase no fuss was mentioned many
foreign journalists didn't know how to
translate it many of us also said at the
time this phrase sounds a bit unrefined
not quite something a leader of a party
and Nation would say but many years
later when we look back at hua's no fuss
don't we find these words truly precious
as a leader it's best not to mess around
follow the path of Reform and opening up
that has already been formed and move
forward in an orderly manner you better
not have such strong abilities you
better not have such high Ambitions so
in my opinion actually someone like Le K
Chang if he really becomes the highest
leader of the Chinese Communist party it
might actually be a good thing for this
country but regardless Le Kang age 68
died suddenly which can also be seen as
a symbol from a certain
perspective this symbol also signifies
that after 40 Years of Reform and
opening up the system established by the
CC to select and recommend top leaders
has come to a complete and definitive
end but for the CCP is this a good thing
or a bad thing that's all for today
