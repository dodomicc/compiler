the Chinese government has reacted
sharply to the release suspending the
import of all Japanese Marine Products
there have been many highly critical
stories on Chinese newscasts but a
Chinese journalist now living in Tokyo
says people in China are not hearing all
the facts from statun media in that
country he decided to cover the
situation
himself veteran Chinese journalist Wang
Xian visiting Fukushima prefecture last
month
he heard directly from local people
about the nuclear accident and the
impact of the treated water
release I came here to see what they
experienced and how they're
coping he says he wants to tell Chinese
citizens about the current situation in
Fukushima what he has seen with his own
eyes Wong was a reporter on state run
China central television and produced a
program that sharply criticized social
issues in his country
but he quit his job six years ago
because he says he was no longer allowed
to freely report the facts as the
government tightened control on
speech last year he decided to move to
Tokyo to continue his
work he independently analyzes news from
China and distributes it to Chinese
citizens in Japan and
Beyond our society seems to be further
away from the rule of
law the news of the release of treated
water from Fukushima was especially big
news in
China China firmly opposes and strongly
condemns it we have made serious
approaches to Japan and asked it to stop
this
wrongdoing W feels the current situation
in Fukushima is much different than what
the Chinese news has been
reporting
ordinary Chinese people misunderstand it
because the authorities only provide
them with limited
information I believe that if I tell
people what is happening in Fukushima in
a video Chinese viewers will sympathize
with me and their view on the nuclear
accident will
change so Wang cover the Tokyo Electric
Power Company and the Fukushima Dai
nuclear power plant by himself TECO
officials explained to him that the
treated water is being released after
being diluted to levels well within
International safety limits Wong was
also told daily analysis of the seawater
shows tritium levels well below those
that would prompt the company to stop
releasing treated
water tepco has been dealing with the
matter very strictly and found that
there is no
problem the data released to the outside
and all the data were the
same Wong also interviewed nearly a
dozen local residents including people
in the fishing industry farmers and
restaurant owners in the
[Music]
region W's report about Fukushima has
been viewed more than 1.7 million times
on his YouTube channel Wong feels it
shows there are people in China who want
to know the truth about
[Music]
Fukushima when I went to the site in
Fukushima my concept of treated water
and residents living in the surrounding
area changed significantly if we
continue to tell Chinese Society about
the reality of Fukushima people will
definitely understand it even younger
Generations who support the Chinese
Communist Party
