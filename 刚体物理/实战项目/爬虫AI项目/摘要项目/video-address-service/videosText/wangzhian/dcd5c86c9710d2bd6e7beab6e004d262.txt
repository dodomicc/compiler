Let's continue our discussion today
on the topic of Lee Keqiang's passing.
After my program finished airing yesterday,
I received an email from a student at Tsinghua University.
He told me, "Wang Sir, do you know why
"there are no memorial activities at Peking University?"
He said he wasn't clear about the specifics
at Peking University, but all the students at Tsinghua
had received a notice from the Youth League Committee,
forbidding them from participating in any offline
or online memorial activities.
He guessed that Peking University students
must have received similar notices.
If it weren't for these notices,
he believes that students from both Peking University
and Tsinghua would have organized
some form of memorial activities.
This explains why there was only a lonely bouquet of flowers
under the statue of Cai Yuanpei at Peking University.
Even such an act of mourning is nearly an act of defiance,
because the school has explicitly ordered not to mourn.
If someone is found laying flowers,
they could be considered in the wrong.
So, can you see?
The mourning activities for Likeqiang in the past few,
days have exhibited an attitude of being relaxed
on the outside but strict on the inside.
What does that mean?
On the surface, it appears that the mourning activities
for Likeqiang are not interfered with.
No one will stop you from mourning,
nor will anyone arrest you at the site of your mourning,
which is also a form of assembly.
But the so-called strictness on the inside
refers to two aspects.
On one hand, if you're within the system,
nearly all institutional systems have received a notice
not to participate in any online
or offline mourning activities.
Since you're under the jurisdiction of an entity,
you must think thrice before acting.
On the other hand, it pertains
to the mourning activities themselves.
As I mentioned in my program yesterday,
blue vests, who are actually city management officers,
started appearing on the scene.
They maintain order on one hand, and on the other,
as I said yesterday, they carve out an area
to chase away those selling flowers
so as to prevent the congregation of people's emotions.
However, these blue vests have another important job,
which is to remove any written memorials from the scene.
Everyone knows that people who come to mourn Likeqiang,
besides bringing fresh flowers,
many would write a memorial message.
These messages are particularly dangerous.
Everyone remembers the April 5th Tiananmen Movement.
It started with spontaneous mourning for Zhou Enlai's death.
At first, it was just about laying flowers, but as it went on,
people began to write memorials, poems,
and even big character posters,
which were read aloud on site.
Eventually, under the backdrop
and resonance of such an atmosphere,
the April 5th Tiananmen Movement was formed.
Hence, the Communist Party has accumulated more experience
in dealing with such mass movements,
especially those caused by the death of political leaders.
You can bring flowers, no problem there.
But besides flowers, don't just say anything you want.
Don't write memorial words casually.
So now, those city management officers on the scene
are taking away all those memorial texts.
Once these memorials are all taken away,
and it's only flowers,
even though the relevant departments might be unhappy.
Look, so many people bringing flowers
for a prime minister like Likeqiang.
What are you implying?
It's like you're trying to give us a signal.
Who can't see that?
But it's still tolerable.
But those memorials become more and more outrageous
as they are written.
Starting with words like "Morning Likeqiang",
phrases and statements he himself had written or said.
They then begin to introduce Likeqiang
to comment on this era, on the past 10 years,
who can't see what's happening.
So in my view, during the mourning of Likeqiang,
these memorials actually became a wall of words
that the public could express openly,
a chance we usually don't get to articulate
our understanding of this era and our views on politics.
Thus, the memorials for Likeqiang
turned into a sort of indirect public expression.
Among these expressions,
the one that struck me the most was one I saw yesterday,
which said, "Artificially designed adoration is fragile
while genuine love and respect are truly touching."
I think this accurately summarizes
the real feelings of the public
during the mourning activities for Likeqiang.
Let's talk about the second part.
Genuine love and respect are truly touching.
It means that even though Likeqiang
may not have been an especially powerful prime minister,
he was generally more personable, didn't put on airs,
and was relatively incorrupt.
Thus, the affection shown by the people
for such a political figure was heartfelt.
Think about it.
Nobody forced them to bring flowers,
there was no organized mobilization.
Didn't all the people spend their own money
to bring bunches of flowers to the site?
In a society like China,
the kind of interaction between the people
and political figures,
if it weren't for organized mobilization,
to be able to muster such a grand scale of force,
that truly would suggest that people's affection
for Likeqiang is heartfelt.
That's the first point.
Second, what does the previous sentence mean
by "Carefully designed worship crumbles easily"?
Who is that referring to?
Isn't that referring to Xi Jinping?
So today we wanna talk about this statement.
As everyone knows, in the last two years,
there has been an international commentary
around Xi Jinping,
which is that he is retracing the path of personal worship
once walked by Mao Zedong.
This is manifested in several ways.
For instance, each leader of the Communist Party
has typically summed up their own theories
and incorporated them into the party's constitution.
There are Mao, Zedong, Thought, Deng Xiaoping, Theory.
The three represents important thought,
the scientific outlook on development.
When it came to Xi Jinping, of course,
he also qualified to have his thoughts written
into the party constitution.
At the 19th National Congress,
Xi Jinping got his thoughts written in,
called Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.
This has a higher status.
First off, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao,
after having their theories included
in the party constitution,
did not have their names attached.
Only two people had that privilege,
Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.
After that, no one's name was attached.
Although it's your theory,
Xi Jinping's name was attached.
That's one thing.
Second, it's not just with his name,
but it's also called thought.
You have to know, within the linguistic framework of China,
thought is of utmost importance.
Deng Xiaoping's was called theory,
and theory is not as high level as thought.
Then, following Jiang Zemin,
although it was called the three
represents important thought,
you must understand that there's a very important qualifier
before thought here.
Three represents.
It implies that Jiang Zemin only had thought
within this particular scope.
As for Hu Jintao, it was called
the scientific outlook on development.
Outlook turns into a viewpoint,
which is of even lower status.
But Xi Jinping brought back the term thought,
as in thought on socialism
with Chinese characteristics for a new era.
So, think about it.
Xi Jinping clearly surpasses Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin,
reaching the stature of Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong.
And following that,
it's not just that he has his distinct thoughts
written into the party constitution.
He also launched a series of activities.
Take, for instance, he published a large number of works,
so-called works like selected readings
from Xi Jinping's works,
various books by Xi Jinping.
If you look at the book rankings now,
Xi Jinping's works are as numerous as old Mao's
back in the day.
And another thing,
it's not just that he has this
characteristic socialist thought.
He now has various kinds of thoughts.
Just a few days ago,
didn't he introduce something called Xi Jinping's
cultural thought?
Then it was officially proposed,
and now it's being studied all over the country.
What is Xi Jinping's cultural thought?
I've also looked into it.
It's about telling China's story well,
establishing our own cultural confidence
and confidence in China's system,
and when dealing with the West,
establishing our own right to speak and so on.
In short, it's the whole set.
Then, during the previous period,
when they did the selected readings
from Xi Jinping's works,
Kai Qi was there saying,
"It needs to enter the brain, heart, and soul."
We did a program on it at the time.
These words and actions naturally make people
think of old Mao because,
in essence, they are all tied to the cult of personality.
So many people worry that after you,
Xi Jinping, have done this cultural thought,
you then do military thought,
then diplomatic thought.
After you go through all these thoughts,
you naturally come up with Xi Jinping thought.
Because if you don't have a qualifier before,
you call it Xi Jinping thought,
because he is a god.
He is different from us common people.
Therefore, you can't constrain him,
nor can you oversee him.
You can't even casually interact with him.
His messages are completely isolated from common people
to ensure what?
To ensure the absolutization of his power.
So for the holders of absolute power,
the easiest way to consolidate power
is through personal worship.
However, after Ding Xiaoping came to power,
everyone knows that the lifetime tenure
of leading cadres was broken.
Therefore, the holders of power
no longer need personal worship.
That is to say, your theory encompasses everything.
You become a divine person.
You are no longer a common person.
Because now Jiang Zemin can only form thoughts
in three represents.
Ding Xiaoping can only be called theory.
Once it is called Xi Jinping thought,
it is completely the same as Mao Zedong.
What is Mao Zedong?
Mao Zedong is the all-encompassing founder
of communist theory.
Many people are worried about this.
Will we go this far?
We don't know.
First of all, I want to analyze a problem.
That is, why does Xi Jinping want to do these things?
In my opinion, a very important reason is
to establish a lifetime tenure system.
He actually needs to engage in personal worship.
Everyone can review history.
Didn't Mao Zedong engage in personal worship
after the founding of the country?
In fact, it started in Yan'an, the seventh congress
proposed Mao Zedong thought.
However, there is not such a direct connection
between Mao Zedong thought and personal worship.
After the founding of the country,
there was a period of time when there were restrictions
and criticisms of Mao Zedong within the party,
especially after the failure of the Great Leap Forward.
Liu Shaoqi and others in the party believed
that Mao Zedong made such a radical mistake at the time.
When he was at the eighth congress,
didn't he admit his mistakes and review them?
So Mao Zedong's authority was not said to be absolute.
But in the end, through the Cultural Revolution,
he overthrew all those who questioned his power
like Liu Shaoqi and built a peak of personal worship.
Why did he engage in personal worship?
He once said a word, he said,
why was Khrushchev ousted?
It's because Khrushchev didn't engage in personal worship.
Everyone knows that during the time when Stalin
was in power in the Soviet Union,
Stalin's personal worship also reached its peak.
Then after Stalin's death, Khrushchev came to power.
Khrushchev opposed Stalin's personal worship.
So he made a secret report at the 20th Congress
of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
As a result, after Khrushchev overthrew Stalin,
he also removed his own political divinity.
And in the end, he was driven down by others.
So Mao Zedong thought that Khrushchev
was actually lifting a rock and hitting himself in the foot.
You are doing socialism.
How can you not engage in personal worship?
So Mao Zedong invented a theory saying that personal worship
is divided into two types.
One is called good personal worship
and the other is called bad personal worship.
So Mao Zedong thought you worship me
is good personal worship.
You worship our enemies or say we think bad people.
That is called bad personal worship.
So there was a huge wave of personal worship
against Mao Zedong across the country.
And this kind of personal worship
is actually a deification of power.
That is, we cannot question this person.
We can't even criticize him.
It's treating him as a completely different species
from us common people.
In fact, the personal worship of all power holders
is a behavior and process of deifying power.
Because Mao Zedong was through various political worships
and personal worships launched against him,
he was able to possess godlike power.
I once said about Mao Zedong,
he is among all the feudal emperors in Chinese history,
the one with the greatest power compared to them.
He not only enjoyed the absolutely unconstrained power
that feudal emperors had,
but also enjoyed the halo of people shouting and worship.
Because personal worship is about being absolute.
Your power is absolute.
And others obedience to you is absolute.
When your power enters a normal replacement situation,
everyone is in power for 10 years.
You retire when it's time.
And after retirement, you become a common person,
no longer a holder of power.
Personal worship naturally has no market.
But now the situation has changed again.
After Xi Jinping came to power,
everyone knows that at the 20th Congress,
he officially began to serve his third term
and he did not make it clear
how many terms he would serve in the future.
It looks like he is going to establish
a lifetime tenure system.
So he faces a problem.
He must build his own power legitimacy.
What does this power legitimacy mean?
From a term system, it becomes possessing absolute power,
unbounded and unchallenged system.
So what to do?
The most effective way is to engage in personal worship.
Selected readings from Xi Jinping
with the slogan, "Into the brain,
"in to the heart, in to the soul."
In my view, all these measures are attempts by Xi Jinping
to construct a god-like persona of absolute authority
among the common populace,
as well as within his party's hierarchy.
Following this thought, I'd like to pose a question.
Is this approach effective?
Does it achieve its intended purpose?
Personally, I find it unlikely.
Why?
Because the era we live in now is markedly different
from the time of Mao Zedong.
During Mao's reign, he managed to establish a realm
of absolute information isolation
between China and the outside world,
somewhat akin to modern day North Korea.
As we all can see, the adoration towards
little fatty Kim Jong-un in North Korea is extravagant.
It appears ludicrous to us.
Why do the common folk react with such uproarious enthusiasm
at the sight of Kim Jong-un?
It's because their information is isolated.
They live on an information island,
oblivious to the political dynamics
and the level of scrutiny politicians face
in other countries.
Through this tactic of information isolation and feeding,
Kim established his dynasty's power structure.
But can this be replicated in today's China?
I don't think so.
After all, post the 40 years of reform and opening up,
although we have the so-called great firewall,
there still exists a flow of information
between us and the outside world.
Over the past 40 years, we've seen foreign leaders
and how foreign political systems operate and function.
We know that in a normal country,
leaders cannot hold lifelong positions.
They can't be always right.
In a normal country, political leaders are bound by
and accountable to the populace.
We also know that in a normal country,
these so-called political leaders
should not be revered by the public.
Instead, they should serve as protectors
of the public's interests.
This brings me to my second point.
After 40 years of enlightenment through reform and opening up,
I believe a large majority of the Chinese populace
has undergone a mental awakening.
What does this awakening entail?
It signifies that the relationship
between the common folk and politicians
is not one of groveling at the politicians' feet,
but rather one where politicians should work
for the welfare of the people.
This understanding has seeped into the bones
of almost every Chinese, especially the educated ones,
and has become a self-awareness.
Under such cognition, attempting to foster
a cult of personality is difficult.
What does a cult of personality establish?
It establishes a relationship between you and the politician
as one between a god and a human,
where the politician is always wiser, always right,
and you are perpetually in an ignorant,
humble state before them.
But once the populace is awakened,
recreating such a state is, to put it mildly,
harder than reaching the skies.
This is precisely why, during the nationwide
mourning events for Li Keqiang,
people wrote these two sentences.
The meticulously constructed adoration crumbles easily.
The heartfelt reverence is touching.
What does it mean?
No matter how much effort you put into building
personal adoration among the populace,
although within your controlled information system,
we have no means to express our discontent or disdain,
the moment a tiny spark or a slight opportunity arises,
you will realize that your so-called "Emperor's New Clothes"
can't withstand a blow.
This was the most powerful outcry from the people
during Li Keqiang's memorial events.
It also tells you why the relevant departments
had to collect all these written memorials.
Because they voiced the people's hearts,
and such voices cannot be spread.
They must be suppressed.
There's a need to meticulously reconstruct
the so-called personal adoration.
However, in an awakened era, in my view,
all these efforts are in vain.
Ultimately, whether a political figure can earn
the recognition or even the adoration of the populace
in the current times, boils down to one criterion.
Whether you, during your term, are working for the welfare
of the general public, and not consolidating
as much power as possible for yourself,
when your term is over, do you transfer this power to others,
or do you clutch onto this power and never let go,
placing any challenges in dire straits?
I believe this has become a basic consensus
in modern political civilization.
You can imagine that in our history,
there was indeed a form of adoration
towards political strongmen, such as Mao Zedong.
When Mao Zedong died, he was still tightly gripping
onto power.
This was because he, through personal adoration,
constructed a so-called deified scenario.
You can imagine how many people in present-day China
still worship or respect Mao Zedong.
Of course, I don't deny that many people still harbor
affection for Mao Zedong.
However, in my view, this is largely due
to the lack of transparency in information.
If you were to understand Mao Zedong,
his reckless actions during his tenure,
the ugly visage of his relentless grasp on power,
even unto death, or say, his brutal suppression
of others in political struggles,
I believe not many would still respect him from the heart.
I think many political figures, when seizing such power
like Mao Zedong, on one hand, maybe for personal gains,
but aren't they also seeking a historical positioning?
Yet, imagine, although while alive,
you could protect your power through such meticulously
constructed personal adoration,
what about after your death?
Suppose 300 or 200 years after your death,
when people evaluate you, showing complete disdain,
even contempt towards you.
Do you think the power you clutched onto today
really holds that much value?
Therefore, in my view, the so-called meticulously
constructed personal adoration is extremely fragile.
What really matters in today's political process
is the public's heart.
Any political figure, even if you possess power
beyond all institutional constraints,
if you cannot win the public's heart,
cannot gain their approval, all these political adorations
are indeed extremely fragile.
Okay, that's all I have for today.
Thank you, everyone.
