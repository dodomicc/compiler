cryogenic temperatures of several
hundred degrees below zero and if you
followed along with our PR 33 much
larger Raptor engines this this great
view of the is the little that is very
different from Falcon I'm sure people
have watched our launches and sometimes
that's all you need sometimes the wins
dip just enough where you can launch
them really C event game
4un play director Ty Huntington telling
the team we are go for launch so 20
seconds to
go t 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 3
[Music]
Starship it's the biggest most powerful
of the biggest rocket ever the most
powerful rocket ever
built
10 9 8 8 7 6 I for

about 3 minutes into its Ascent we're
going to expect to see super heavy
separate from the Starship it it'll
perform a flip maneuver and then it'll
execute a boost back burn and we're
going to be targeting a hard Landing in
the Gulf of Mexico and well that's
happening we hope to see starship's six
second stage engines ignite and watch us
Starship coasts for about an hour
onboard view from
Starship and there's views of the Raptor
engines on the second stage as we
prepare for stage separation now after
stage separation the first stage will
fall flip and begin a boost back
maneuver for landing in the
[Music]
golf
[Music]
there's obviously a massive upgrade to
the Launchpad so we've got like many
niagro Falls here the water pressure is
so much that if it went straight up it
would actually destroyed the rocket
that's how much water pressure it
[Music]
is
[Music]
4 3 2
[Applause]
ping
[Music]
down we 40 seconds into the
flight
Eng power and nominal we've heard power
and Telemetry nominal call out we're
heading down range over the B
Mexico
[Music]
get B out tell a stair do the FY of
right a Str
and the way
SP
[Music]
next
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
we
position
Corp continuing to get good call outs
our trajectory looking nominal systems
looking nominal just amazing to see all
33 lit up once
[Applause]
[Music]
again this point we've already passed
through Max that maximum Dynamic
pressure and passing supersonic so we're
now moving faster than the speed of
sound getting those onboard views from
the ship cameras carrying the ship into
space booster will start to do its flip
and then move into the Boost back burn
setting it up for eventual splash down
in the Gulf of
[Applause]
Mexico
that boost back burn that boost back
burn propels the booster back towards
the coast taking it to a landing in the
waters of the Gulf of
Mexico uh we you can see the grid fins
are
rotating every in the center for Flash
down let's see if that'll
[Applause]
work we're getting a few a few
[Applause]
[Music]
engines uh at that point chip will or
I'm sorry actually it already has umip
engine cut off there we
go we're back here at t+ 40 minutes Pez
door is opening and there we just heard
call it that Pez door is opening so
that's great first
test
oh man we can see the heating on those
flaps as we're starting to re-enter the
Earth's atmosphere this is where the
Earth's atmosphere is doing the work to
slow us down uh like yeah now this was
one of the critical but you want the
vehicle to remain stable you want those
heat shield tiles pointed
down
